/* 2.2 Variables
console.log(argument) is the basic print function for console;
JS reads your code from top to bottom;
Variable in programming is used to save or hold a value;
When you need to repeatedly use same value or need to change
certain value that is used in other parts of your code,
it is better to save that value as a variable;
In order to create a variable, code as below:
const a = 5;
Now whenever you use your variable (a) in your code, it will bring the value (5);
If your variable name is longer than a single word,
convention is to use camelCaseSystem in JS;
