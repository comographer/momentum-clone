/* 2.2 Variables
console.log(argument) is the basic print function for console;
JS reads your code from top to bottom;
Variable in programming is used to save or hold a value;
When you need to repeatedly use same value or need to change
certain value that is used in other parts of your code,
it is better to save that value as a variable;
In order to create a variable, code as below:
const a = 5;
Now whenever you use your variable (a) in your code, it will bring the value (5);
If your variable name is longer than a single word,
convention is to use camelCaseSystem in JS;
*/

/* 2.3 const and let
There are two ways of creating variables;
const and let;
const creates a fixed variable that cannot be changed;
let creates a changeable variable;
If you need to update your variable in the future, you should use let and otherwise const;
By default, the convention is to use const unless you need to use let;
